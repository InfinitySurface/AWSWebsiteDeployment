# Website Deployment using AWS Services

Welcome to my static website that is being hosted on a public S3 bucket using the Amazon Web Services which is also using CloudFront to speed up content delivery!
My website will offer insights about me as a person. As you explore each page, you will have a better understanding of certain things that I have a passion for.

## About The Project

This entire project was created and deployed by using Amazons Web Services. AWS offers a variety of different services that can be used for many cloud development projects. Some of the services that I used to deploy my static website include:

### S3
* Simple Storage Service (S3)
* An object storage service that is advertised as "infinitely scaling"
* Creates a bucket that can store data, files, videos and pictures

### IAM
* Identify and Access Management Services (IAM)
* With IAM you can specify who can access which services and resources under certain conditions.
* Great for managing a whole workforce
  
### EC2
* Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
* Service that provides virtual machines for users in the cloud
* Resizable capacity that provides several pricing options

### CloudFront
* Offers content delivery through a globally-distributed network
* Improves read performance by caching the content at the edge location
* Improves security with traffic encryption and access controls

### Built With

While I used AWS to deploy my website, I used 2 different HTML editors to help construct my pages for the website.

* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

## Getting Started

Once you clicked on the link, you will be taken to the home page of the website. 

### Navigation

Located in the lower left corner of the webpage you will find 4 different buttons each with a different name inside.
