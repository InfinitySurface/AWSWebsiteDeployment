# Website Deployment using AWS Services

Welcome to my static website that is being hosted on a public S3 bucket using the Amazon Web Services which is also using CloudFront to speed up content delivery!
My website will offer insights about me as a person. As you explore each page, you will have a better understanding of certain things that I have a passion for.
